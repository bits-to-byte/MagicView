2. Accelerometer sensors on the Remote enable us to set the projector in whatever angle we tilt the remote. 
3. Projector is equipped with dual axis movement which makes it capable of projecting the screen anywhere.
3. Control configuration of multiple projectors from a single app. Use your mobile phone as a Remote.

### :satellite: Future Work

1. Gathering more reliable public records of medicine stores. We have developed one other app which helps the hospital faculty to register patients and the resources they have. So with the help of that database, we can fetch the information regarding authentic resources.  
2. Link the watch with centrally verified resources regarding lockdown updates. 
3. Add support for covid APIs which will fetch the result based on location (where the user is currently staying) and update the user with the current statistics of the pandemic in their area.
4. Add support so that other users can also raise a request for resources as well as provide the resources to the person in need.
