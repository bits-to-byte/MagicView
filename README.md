## MagicView 

### Description 

Magic View is a smart visual solution that helps us present and watch stuff in a very convenient way and make it movable according to our needs. The setup comes with three very compatible modules i.e. a moving IoT device, a smart remote, and a mobile application. This moving IoT device can be then used with any projector so that we can control it with either our remote or mobile application.  

### Why Magic View ? 
Magic view will help you to enable smart projection in your home, office, or wherever you want. For example if you are at your home, want to chill and relax so use your Netflix connect you TV or laptop with the projector and set your new location to the ceiling wall with your magic remote and yeah that's it :stars:

Similarly if you're at office confrence hall, so no need to change move your projector just cast it in different locations and control it with your mobile phone or remote.

Not only this, also for the people who are old aged or specially abled they can just relax and move the projector according to their filed of view where then can relax without any medical strain :older_man:

So now make your Work From Home more intresting take some rest - > on your TV -> Binge something -> and relax :D 

### :star: Features 

1. Project whatever you want, it can be a photo, video, or any other media (it should be able to project through projector).
2. Useful in office meetings to home entertainment.
3. Easily accessible through mobile app or magic remote
4. Project anywhere at any angle for and avoid the health hazards of Neck pain and making it easier for people already suffering from diseases like Spondilytis. 
5. No need for multiple remotes for different projectors. Control and configure everything at one place.


### âš¡Components 
1. Accelerometer sensors on the Remote enable us to set the projector in whatever angle we tilt the remote. 
2. Projector is equipped with dual axis movement which makes it capable of projecting the screen anywhere.
3. Control configuration of multiple projectors from a single app. Use your mobile phone as a Remote. 
4. Store the coordinates of the most used locations in a room on the server for quick projection.

### :page_with_curl: App Documentation

For making it more accessible we will added the support to control this dual axis projector using mobile also, this would be a cross platfrom app which will connect with the dual axis device over http connection using NodeMCU and the app by the help of [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) plugin of Flutter. 
The app wll provie features like - 
1) User can control the device throught the joystick, and it will be as simple as we control any games controller. Once the joystick is updated it will send the new moving coordinates to dual projector and yeah that's it now enjoy your movie wherever you want.
2) It will also provide some other controls like Power, Menu, and Save.
3) You can also save the frequent projection location so that if you are in office so need to configure the joystick everytime, just click on last saved projection and enjoy the pitch.

The information(frequent projection location and frequently used projectors) will be then stored in cockroach DB. As of now becuase everything is online so we were not able to integrate the app with the real hardware, but the procedure will be same :D

### :satellite: Future Work

1. Complete the app support so that it will become moew accessible, and also add some gesutres to make it more easy to use.
2. Make this whole as a one module, so the user just need to plug sit and play (Ok move also :P).
3. Add more field of view.
